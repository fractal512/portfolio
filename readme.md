## Portfolio (Laravel)

The mirror [laravel.fractal512.pp.ua](http://laravel.fractal512.pp.ua) of my Portfolio site [fractal512.pp.ua](http://fractal512.pp.ua) (initially made on Wordpress) running on Laravel Framework.

It made for educational purposes to study Laravel Framework.

Mirror uses the same standard [Wordpress database](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description) table structure as the main site and additional tables of [Photo Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/photo-gallery/) plugin.
Also, it uses the same media files from the main site.

Additionally, it uses my package [fractal512/captcha](https://github.com/fractal512/captcha) (accessible via composer `composer require fractal512/captcha`) to prevent spam from the contact form on the main page.
